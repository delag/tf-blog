A reproducable repo to spin up a containerized Ghost blog on Digital Ocean with Cloudflare in front.

## Documentation/Usage

Major credit/inspirtation goes to Vortexmind's [repo](https://github.com/Vortexmind/terraforming-ghost). 

You can visit the repo to find an expanded version of this setup that includes Commento.

I have taken slightly different routes with naming conventions and choices and as such decided to spin up my own repo.
